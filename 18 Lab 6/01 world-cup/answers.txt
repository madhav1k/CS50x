Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: Almost all were incorrect except for Belgium being one of the top 4 winners (still in the wrong spot though). Belgium was on the correct #3 spot with 100 simulations.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: after 1000 as the predictions are wrong anyways so why spend temporal resources on more simulations, when similar results can be achieved with a fraction of the spent time. But the predictions kind of stabilized starting from 1000 simulations.
